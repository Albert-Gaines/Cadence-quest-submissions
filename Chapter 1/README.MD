1. The blockchain to me is a sort of free market while eradicating the corruption but making transactions public but also freeing the individuals money from any governing body, allowing them to buy/sell/trade their funds at their leisure/discretion.

2. Smart contract is a program that specifically denotes it function. (must be precise in its function)

3. A script is how you can view data on the blockchain(only view---free) while a transaction is a paid function call. Its how data can be changed on the blockchain.
