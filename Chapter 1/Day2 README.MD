Quest chapter 1 day 2:
1. Safety and security = Strong type system, seperates contracts from transactions,  Mucho mucho secure
   Clarity = code needs to be easy to read,make the code declarative 
   Approachability = very similar to swift and react
   Developer Experiance = error messages are easy to read, makes for a easier time debugging
   Resource Oriented Programming = Resources are 80% of everything of everything we do on cadence
   
   2. In my opinion I think the five pillars are crucial to the blockchain due to the easy to read code and the comparative language to swift and react.
    The safety of the strong type system and declarative code the risk of malicous code should foreseeabley decrease.
